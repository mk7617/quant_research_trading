# Trading & Investment Research

This repository is a workspace for my development and research in algorithmic trading and long-term investment strategies.

### Purpose

- Explore and prototype trading algorithms
- Backtest strategies using historical market data
- Connect to live brokerages like Interactive Brokers (IBKR) for execution
- Analyze performance, risk, and behavior of systematic portfolios

### Contents

- **Backtesting Scripts** – Python scripts and notebooks for evaluating strategies such as risk parity, momentum, and allocation models.
- **Live Trading Bots** – Automated scripts for executing trades through IBKR using the `ib_insync` API.
- **Performance Analytics** – Tools for calculating portfolio metrics, Sharpe ratios, drawdowns, and visual summaries.

### Note

This is a personal research environment. Code may evolve or remain experimental in places.  
Use it at your own discretion and always validate strategies before real-money deployment.
